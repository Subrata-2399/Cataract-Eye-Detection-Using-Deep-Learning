# Cataract-Eye-detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to develop an advanced computer vision system for the early detection of cataracts in human eyes. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the well-known VGG19 architecture, our model is designed to analyze eye images and accurately identify the presence of cataracts.
